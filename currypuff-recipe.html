      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions
          and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the garlic, ginger, and Malaysian curry powder and cook until
          fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the ground chicken and cook, breaking it up into small pieces
          withs a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the potatoes, tomato puree, coconut milk, water, brown sugar,
          and salt. Cover and let the mixture simmer until the potatoes are
          fork-tender and the mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the lime juice, season with more salt to taste, and transfer
          the filling to a bowl to let it cool completely. (If making ahead of
          time, refrigerate for up to 3 days.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unfold the thawed puff pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Using
          a rolling pin, roll out both sheets of puff pastry into 12-inch
          squares. Use the tip of a knife or pizza cutter to cut each square
          into 9 equal pieces, creating 18 squares.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beat the egg with the milk, and brush the edges of each pastry square
          with egg wash.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken filling into the center of each
          pastry square.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pick up and fold one corner of a pastry over the filling to make a
          triangle, and use a fork to crimp the edges sealed. Repeat with the
          remaining pastries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange the curry puffs evenly on the prepared baking sheet, leaving
          space between each. Brush the tops and edges with the prepared egg
          wash, and sprinkle with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 30 minutes or until the curry puffs are golden brown and
          puffy. The puffs will be very hot when done — let rest for at least 10
          minutes before eating.
