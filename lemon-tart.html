    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>For the crust:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat over to 400°. Generously spray a 9-inch tart pan with a
        removable bottom with baking spray. Rub with a paper towel to make sure
        all the surfaces are well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the butter, oil, water and salt in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover
        the bowl with a plate or some damp paper toweling. Microwave on high
        power for 3 minutes. Carefully remove the bowl from the microwave (it
        will be hot) and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar to the warm butter mixture and stir to combine. Then add
        the flour and coconut. Mix until well combined (I use a silicone spatula
        or wooden spoon) and the dough comes together and forms a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom (you
        could also use a 9-inch pie pan). Break up half of the dough into small
        walnut size pieces and line them up around the edges of the pan. Press
        the dough around the edges of the pan, forming a crust about ¼-.inch
        thick and even with the top of the pan. Then press the remaining dough
        firmly into the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until a light, golden
        brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool partially while you
        make the lemon filling.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the lemon filling:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks,
        sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice and salt (⅛ teaspoon if using unsalted
        butter) until smooth. Add butter cubes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microwave on high power for 45 seconds. Remove from the microwave and
        stir vigorously with a whisk. Continue to cook at 45-second intervals,
        stirring after each interval. It will take 4-7 minutes, depending on the
        power of your microwave. Lemon curd is done cooking when it coats the
        back of a metal spoon. You can also check it with an instant
        thermometer. It’s done when it reaches 175˚F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the microwave and whisk well. Pour the lemon mixture into a
        fine-mesh sieve with a bowl set underneath. Stir and allow the mixture
        to be strained into the bowl. Keep stirring until all of the lemon
        mixture has been strained. Discard any solids in the sieve. (I like to
        do this in my sink as it gives me a good angle to stir from.) This step
        is optional but makes for a silky smooth filling. If you don’t have a
        fine-mesh sieve, just proceed with the next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the lemon filling into the prepared crust, smoothing the top. Bake
        in the preheated oven for 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the
        tart to cool completely. It will be wobbly when it’s warm but will set
        nicely for slicing once it’s cooled. Serve with a sprinkle of powdered
        sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, fresh fruit and/or a drizzle of
        raspberry coulis. ENJOY!
