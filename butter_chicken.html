    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté
        shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam
        masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10
        minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from
        heat and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium
        heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and
        cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has
        reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce
        and stir together.

        Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to
