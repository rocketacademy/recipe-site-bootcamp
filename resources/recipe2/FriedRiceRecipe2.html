      soy sauce is all you need. Garnish with sliced green onions, if desired.

    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <p>
      If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine
      4 cups water and 2 cups white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce
      heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed,
      20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.
      For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours
      to overnight, before using in this recipe.
