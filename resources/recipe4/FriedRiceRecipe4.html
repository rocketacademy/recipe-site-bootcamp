    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat up a wok or pan with the oil.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and stir fry until aromatic</li>
      <li>follow by the chicken, shrimp, and mixed vegetables.</li>
      <li>Stir fry until the chicken and shrimp are half cooked.</li>
      <li>Add in the rice and stir well with the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Add the fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, white pepper and continue
        to stir the fried rice for a couple of minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the spatula, push the rice to the side of the wok and make a
        "well" in the middle of the fried rice.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the beaten eggs in the "well."</li>
      <li>Wait for 30 seconds and then cover the eggs with the fried rice.</li>
      <li>Leave it for 30 seconds to 1 minute</li>
      <li>
        continue to stir-fry so the eggs form into small pieces and mix well
        with the fried rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt to taste and do some quick stirs, dish out and serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do not use fresh steamed rice as the rice grains have too much moisture
        content and too starchy for stir fry. The rice will clump and stick
        together in lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use leftover steamed rice, or “overnight” rice. It means rice that had
        been left overnight in the refrigerator as the rain grains are drier and
        have lost the moisture content.
      </li>
      <li>
        The next time you dine out at Chinese restaurants or takeout
        restaurants, ask for an extra serving of steamed white rice. Bring it
        home and keep in the refrigerator. The next day, you have the perfect
        “overnight” or leftover rice which is great for making this recipe.
