      ☞ 3 cloves garlic, minced<br />☞ 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger<br />

    <h2>🧑🏻‍🍳 INSTRUCTIONS 👩🏻‍🍳</h2>
    <p>
      1. In a large pot of boiling water, add Yaki-Soba until loosened, about
      1-2 minutes; drain well.<br />
      2. In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup water; set
      aside.<br />
      3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add soy sauce, brown sugar,
      garlic, ginger, honey and 1 cup water; bring to a simmer. Stir in
      cornstarch mixture until thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon,
      about 2 minutes; let cool to room temperature. Reserve 1/4 cup and set
      aside.<br />
      4. In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine soy sauce mixture
      and chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes to overnight, turning the
      bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade.<br />
      5. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and
      cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes; set
      aside.<br />
      6. Stir in Yaki-Soba and 1/4 cup reserved soy sauce mixture until well
      combined, about 2 minutes. 7. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame
      seeds and green onion, if desired.<br />
