    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and bell
        pepper and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper and cook for another
        minute, stirring constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the can of whole peeled tomatoes with their juices and use a
        wooden spoon to break them into smaller pieces. Bring the mixture to a
        simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spoon, make 6 small wells in the sauce. Crack an egg into each
        well and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until the egg whites are set but the yolks
        are still runny, about 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro and serve hot with crusty
        bread or pita.
      </li>
