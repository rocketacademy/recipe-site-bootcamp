      <p>Instructions:</p>
      <ol class="instructions">
        <li>
          Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon
          salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with hot
          water for serving, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and
          Parmesan. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over
          medium heat, add the pork, and sauté until the fat just renders, on
          the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just
          before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, if needed. Reserve
          1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low
          heat. Stir for a minute or so.
        </li>
        <li>
          Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture.
          Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for
          creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional
          grated pecorino and pepper.
        </li>
