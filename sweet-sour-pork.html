    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the pork tenderloin into pieces and marinate with the ingredients
        for 15-20 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>Mix the sweet and sour sauce ingredients well and set aside.</li>

      <li>
        Strain the dry ingredients of the frying batter and then add in the egg,
        water, and cooking oil to form a thick batter.
      </li>

      <li>
        When the pork is well-marinated, transfer the pork pieces into the
        batter and make sure they are well coated. In a deep skillet, add in the
        cooking oil enough for deep-frying. Once the oil is hot, deep fry the
        pork pieces until they turn golden brown. Dish out and drain on paper
        towels.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat up a wok and add in some cooking oil. Add in the chopped garlic and
        stir fry until light brown, then follow by the bell peppers and
        pineapple pieces. Stir fry until you smell the peppery aroma from the
        peppers and then add in the sweet and sour sauce. As soon as the sauce
        thickenens, transfer the pork into the wok and stir well with the sauce.
        Add in the chopped scallions, do a few quick stirs, dish out and serve
        hot with steamed white rice.
