        <p>
          These sesame noodles are colorful and completely irresistible! I’m
          always excited when I find sesame noodles amongst a plethora of dishes
          at a gathering. As a solo dish, I crave noodles with a little more
          color, perhaps, and more texture and flavor. Must be the “maximalist
          vegetarian” in me. Always more veggies!

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>8 ounces soba noodles or spaghetti noodles of choice</li>
          <li>¼ cup raw sesame seeds</li>
          <li>
            ⅓ cup reduced sodium tamari (or soy sauce, just be sure it’s reduced
            sodium or it will taste too salty)
          </li>
          <li>¼ cup toasted sesame oil</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 medium lime)</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
          <li>
            2 ½ cups thinly sliced red cabbage (about 10 ounces or ¼th medium
            cabbage)
          </li>
          <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced into very thin strips</li>
          <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
          <li>Optional: 2 cups shelled edamame, steamed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cook the soba noodles according to the package directions. Once
            they’re done cooking, drain them in a colander and rinse them well
            under cool water. Transfer the drained noodles to a large serving
            bowl and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium
            heat, stirring often (keep an eye on them, as they can burn
            quickly). Once they’re fragrant and turning golden, transfer them to
            a small bowl so they don’t burn. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In another bowl, combine the tamari, sesame oil, lime juice, and
            garlic. Whisk until blended. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            To assemble, add the cabbage, bell pepper, green onions, and
            optional edamame to your bowl with the noodles. Drizzle in the
            dressing. Add all of the sesame seeds, and use tongs to toss until
            the mixture is fully combined. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for
            later. This salad is best consumed within a couple of days, but it
            will keep for up to 5 days.
