      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 F.</li>
        <li>Wash and peel the Yukon potatoes. Using a mandoline or a sharp knife, thinly slice the potatoes to about ⅛-inch thickness. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, cream, sliced garlic, and thyme sprigs.</li>
        <li>
          Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally and allow to cook until it is reduced by about ¼, about 15 minutes. Season with salt
          and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange half of the sliced potatoes in the prepared baking dish, slightly overlapping. Add half the cheese, then arrange the remaining
          sliced potatoes on top. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the cream mixture evenly over the pan.</li>
        <li>
          Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown and
          bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove from the oven and let the gratin sit for about 10 minutes to set before serving. Garnish with additional fresh thyme, if desired.
          Serve hot.
        </li>
