            Heaped tablespoon minced garlic (4 cloves)<br>
            2 bay leaves<br>
            3 sprigs fresh thyme or use 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme<br>
            1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs (4 or 5 thighs)<br>
            8 cups chicken stock or broth, low sodium or use homemade stock<br>

        <h2> Instructions</h2>
        <p>How to Make Ultra-Satisfying Chicken Noodle Soup:<br>
            1. Melt butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery. Cook,
            stirring every few minutes until the vegetables begin to soften; 5 to 6 minutes.<br>
            Drain and stir in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.<br>
            2. Stir in the garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Cook, while stirring the garlic around the pan, for about 1
            minute.<br>
            3. Submerge the chicken thighs into the soup so that the broth covers them. Bring the soup back to a low
            simmer then partially cover the pot with a lid and cook, stirring a few times until the chicken thighs are
            cooked through; about 20 minutes.<br>
            4. If, during this time, the broth seems low, add a splash more stock or a bit of water. Turn the heat to
            medium-low.<br>
            5. Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate. Stir the noodles into the soup and cook until done, 6 to 10
            minutes depending on the type of noodles used.<br>
            6. While the noodles cook, shred the chicken into strips or dice into cubes. Slide the chicken back into the
            pot and then taste the soup once more for seasoning. Adjust with more salt and pepper, as needed. Stir in
            the parsley and serve.<br>
