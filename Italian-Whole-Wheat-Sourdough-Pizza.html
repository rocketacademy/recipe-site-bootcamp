            Sourdough starteWhatever veggies you like! Besides those listed
            here, eggplant, onion, spinach, and zucchini are a few other tasty
            options.
          </li>
          <li>Tomato puree/store-bought pizza sauce, 1/4 cup or to taste</li>
          <li>1/2 pack of oyster mushroom (~50g)</li>
          <li>1/2 a bell pepper, sliced</li>
          <li>Fresh basil, for garnish</li>
          <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>Olive oil, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot (5-quart capacity or greater) of heavily salted
            water to boil. Meanwhile, prepare your kale by slicing or stripping
            the leaves from the stems (save them). Discard the rough bottom of
            the stems, then slice the stems into pieces about ¼-inch wide. Place
            the stem pieces in a fine-mesh sieve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix all dough ingredients and set aside to rise, until it expands
            roughly 1.5 times in volume (depending on how much starter you used,
            and how hot the weather is, it can take 3-6 hours).
          </li>
          <li>
            Shape the dough into a ball, and store it in a covered
            bowl/container in the fridge overnight, or up to 3 days, till you
            are ready to assemble the pizza.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take out the dough ball ~30 minutes before assembling, and let it
            come to room temperature; meanwhile, chop the veggies.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a baking tray lined with parchment paper or pizza stone, drizzle
            a few drops of olive oil and spread it evenly across - this prevents
            the dough from sticking and makes it much easier to handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the dough ball at the centre of the baking tray/pizza stone,
            and start to press it outwards (watch

            for an illustration); then stretch it until you reach the desired
            shaped and thickness (I prefer it thin).
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread the tomato puree or pizza sauce evenly - be careful not to
            use too much as it might make the pizza overly sour.
          </li>
          <li>Add the veggie toppings (except any fresh herbs).</li>
          <li>
            Bake at 250 degrees Celsius for 15-20 minutes, till the veggies and
            dough are cooked through (you will be able to see a distinct colour
            change).
          </li>
          <li>Top with fresh herbs and enjoy!</li>
