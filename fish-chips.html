    <li>Using a fork to whisk continuously, add the beer and the sparkling water to the flour mixture and 
      continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter.Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into a little less than  1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide chips.
  Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold running water</li>
  <li>Place the washed chips into a pan of cold water. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season lightly with a little sea salt.</li>
<li>Place the 2 tablespoons of flour reserved from the batter mix into a shallow bowl. 
  Toss each fish fillet in the flour and shake off any excess.</li>
<li>Dip into the batter, coating the entire fillet</li>
<li>Check that the oil temperature is still 350 F. Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil. 
    Fry for approximately 8 minutes, or until the batter is crisp and golden,
     turning the fillets from time to time with a large slotted spoon.</li>
     <li>Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. 
      Sprinkle with salt. Cover with greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and keep hot</li>
      <li>Heat the oil to 400 F, then cook the chips until golden and crisp, or about 5 minutes. 
        Remove from the oil and drain. Season with salt</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with the hot fish accompanied by your favorite condiment</li>
        </ul>
