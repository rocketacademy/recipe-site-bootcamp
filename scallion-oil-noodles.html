    <p>Preparation time: 1 hour</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>10 scallions</li>
      <li>¾ cup grapeseed or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 lb. fresh Shanghai or lo mein noodles or dried lo mein noodles</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy paste (such as Yu Ding Xing)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut scallions crosswise into thirds, separating dark green parts from
        white and pale green parts. Slice lengthwise into very thin strips,
        keeping dark green and white parts separate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour oil into a cold large wok or high-sided skillet. Add white parts of
        scallions to oil and set over medium-low. Cook until oil starts to
        bubble, about 5 minutes. Add dark green parts of scallions and stir to
        combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are crisped and
        deep golden brown, 20–30 minutes. Do not rush this; slow, gradual
        browning as the liquid in the scallions evaporates will yield the best
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer scallions to paper towels to
        drain. Let scallions and oil cool. Pour oil through a fine-mesh sieve
        into an airtight container; discard solids. Cover and chill scallion oil
        until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to manufacturer’s
        directions, adding 1 Tbsp. reserved scallion oil to the cooking water
        when you add the noodles. Drain noodles, reserving ½ cup cooking liquid,
        and return to pot. Add ½ cup scallion oil and toss to coat. Add soy
        paste and toss to combine. Add soy sauce and toss again, adding cooking
        liquid as needed to loosen sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer noodles to a bowl or platter and top with three-fourths of
        crispy scallions. Serve with remaining scallions in a small bowl
        alongside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Do Ahead:</b> Scallions can be fried 1 day ahead. Keep scallion oil
        chilled; store scallions between layers of paper towels in an airtight
        container at room temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
