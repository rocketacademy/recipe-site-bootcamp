    <h2 class="subheader">Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredient">
      <ul>
        <li>6 medium potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 small onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, plus 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>7 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>Serving suggestion: tomato salad drizzled with olive oil</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheader">Instructions</h2>
    <div class="instruction">
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl mix the potatoes, onions, and 1/2 teaspoon salt by
          hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the
          potatoes and onions on low heat and cover with a lid for 5 minutes to
          let them soften. Turn up the heat for another 5 minutes until golden
          brown. Remove from the stove and drain off any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile break the eggs into a medium bowl. Add the remaining salt
          and milk and whisk vigorously until frothy. Add the potatoes and
          onions to the eggs and mix until fully integrated.
        </li>
        <li>Clean the frying pan and return to stove.</li>
        <li>
          Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil on a high heat and pour in the
          mixture, moving it around in the pan to help the tortilla to rise. Fry
          until golden brown, stirring occasionally until it has set. Then turn
          down the heat to allow the inside to cook. After a few minutes turn up
          the heat in order to brown the tortilla.
        </li>
        <li>
          When it's cooked place a large plate over the frying pan and flip the
          tortilla onto it. Return to the pan and fry the other side until
          golden brown.
        </li>
