          <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
          <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
          <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
          <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
          <li>1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)</li>
          <li>1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced</li>
          <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation Time</h2>
        <p>45 minutes</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Cook the chicken*: Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken
          generously with salt and pepper.
        </p>

        <p>
          Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the
          chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and
          releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over
          and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until
          the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the
          chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make the ramen broth: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat,
          until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few
          minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to
          combine. Cook for another minute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Add the stock, cover, and bring to boil. Remove the lid, and let
          simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer
          gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make the soft-boiled eggs: Fill a pot with enough water to cover the
          eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the
          fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a
          slightly-runny yoke) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yoke).
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes,
          transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at
          least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel
          away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to
          serve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Assemble the ramen bowls: Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño
          (if using). Slice the chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the
          eggs finish cooking, add the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two
          large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the
          fresh scallions, jalapeño and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.
