        <p>
          Today, I wanted to share a shockingly green pasta dish with you. It’s
          easy to make, nourishing and comforting, which is exactly what we need
          right now. I wouldn’t blame you if you find the color off-putting, but
          I promise it’s so tasty!

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fine sea salt</li>
          <li>
            1 large bunch (8 ounces) kale, preferably Tuscan/lacinato but any
            variety works
          </li>
          <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>2 large cloves garlic, smashed and peeled</li>
          <li>Zest and juice from 1 medium lemon, preferably organic</li>
          <li>
            ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, reduce or omit if sensitive to spice
          </li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
          <li>½ pound (8 ounces) rigatoni or pappardelle or pasta of choice</li>
          <li>2 cups (8 ounces) fresh or frozen peas</li>
          <li>¾ cup (2 ounces) coarsely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>½ cup or more ricotta cheese, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot (5-quart capacity or greater) of heavily salted
            water to boil. Meanwhile, prepare your kale by slicing or stripping
            the leaves from the stems (save them). Discard the rough bottom of
            the stems, then slice the stems into pieces about ¼-inch wide. Place
            the stem pieces in a fine-mesh sieve.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the water is boiling, place the sieve in the water, resting the
            lip against the top of the pot. Cook the stems for 3 minutes, then
            remove the sieve and add all of the kale leaves to the pot. Put the
            sieve back in the water on top of the leaves and cook for 5 minutes
            (do not drain the water).
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat.
            Add the garlic and cook until the garlic begins to sizzle, then
            reduce the heat to low. Cook gently, lightly shimmying the pan and
            turning the garlic every now and then, until the garlic is soften
            and turning lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from
            the heat and pour the contents into a stand blender.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the cooked kale stems to the blender when the time’s up. Use
            tongs to transfer the kale leaves over to the blender (you actually
            want to bring some of the water with them). Add most of the zest
            from the lemon, and 1 tablespoon of the juice. Add ¼ teaspoon salt,
            the red pepper flakes (if using), plus about 10 twists of freshly
            ground black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blend until the mixture is completely smooth and silky, adding more
            spoonfuls of water if necessary to gain traction. Taste, and add
            more salt, pepper or pepper flakes, and/or another tablespoon of
            lemon if desired. We want it to taste lemony! Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente according
            to the package directions, stirring often. Place the peas in the
            sieve and cook them in the water until they’re warmed throughout,
            about 1 to 2 minutes if fresh, or 2 to 3 minutes if frozen. Set the
            peas aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before draining the pasta, scoop out about ½ cup of the pasta
            cooking water with a heat-safe measuring cup. Drain the pasta, then
            return it to the pot. Pour in the green sauce, about ¾ of the
            Parmesan and the peas, and add a small splash of the reserved
            cooking water (not the end of the world if you forgot it). Stir
            gently until the pasta is well coated and bright green, adding
            another splash or two of pasta water to loosen the sauce and make it
            almost creamy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide into bowls immediately. Top each with a sprinkle of the
            remaining Parmesan, a few dollops of ricotta, and a sprinkle of
            lemon zest and red pepper flakes (both optional). Finish the bowls
            with a light drizzle of olive oil. Enjoy! Leftovers will keep for up
            to 2 days in the refrigerator, covered (technically, they’ll last up
            to 4, but the flavor degrades as time goes on).
