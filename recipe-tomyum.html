        In a pot, bring 3 cups of water to boil. Add the shrimp head and shell
        to make shrimp stock. Boil until the water turns slightly orange in
        color. Press the shrimp heads with a spatula to extract the juice from
        the heads.

        lime juice too early, the soup might turn bitter). Boil until the
