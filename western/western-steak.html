        To prepare the garlic butter steak recipe with potatoes wedges: In a
        large bowl, <br />combine the steak strips with soy sauce, olive oil,
        pepper, and hot sauce. <br />Set aside and allow steak strips to
        marinate while you cook potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and
        1 tablespoon butter. <br />When butter is melted, add potatoes wedges.
        Cook for about 4 minutes, stir and <br />cook an additional 4-5 minutes
        until potatoes wedges are golden and fork-tender. <br />Transfer sauteed
        potatoes to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2
        tablespoons of butter, garlic, red chili pepper flakes, and fresh herbs.
        <br />Lay the steak strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the
        drained steak marinade for later. Cook the steak strips on each side for
        1 minute each, <br />until nicely browned – adjust timing depending on
        how you like your steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right before the Garlic Butter steak is done, you can stir in the
        reserved marinade if you like, and cook for one minute. <br />Add the
        potatoes wedges back to the garlic butter steak pan and heat through.
        <br />Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and serve immediately your steak and potatoes,
        garnished with more crushed chili pepper, <br />fresh herbs, and a
        sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the potatoes if you like. Enjoy!
