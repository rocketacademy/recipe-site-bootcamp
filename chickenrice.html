    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <h3>COOK THE CHICKEN</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil a large pot of water. In the meantime, clean the chicken by
        exfoliating with kosher or coarse salt. Rinse chicken well, inside and
        outside.
      </li>

      <li>
        PRE-BOIL CHICKEN: When water is at a hard boil, add the chicken. Return
        to hard boil, let scum come to the surface. Boil for 5 minutes. Discard
        all the water, including the scum.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refill pot with clean water to cover the chicken by 1-inch, and add in
        the garlic, green onion and ginger. Bring the pot to a boil over high
        heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. Cook for
        about 30 minutes more (less if you're using a smaller chicken).
      </li>
      <li>
        Check for doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg
        and see if the juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the
        thickest part of the thigh not touching bone. It should read 160F. The
        chicken will continue to cook to 165F during rest.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat and remove the pot
        from the burner. Immediately lift and transfer the chicken into a bath
        of ice water to cool. The quick cooling will stop the cooking process,
        keeping the meat soft and tender, and giving the skin a lovely firm
        texture. After cooling, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub
        the sesame oil all over the chicken. This will help prevent the chicken
        from drying out. SEASON SOUP Discard the garlic, ginger and green onion.
        Season the soup with salt to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>COOK THE RICE</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place rice into a large bowl, and fill with water. Use your hands to
        swish the water around, cleaning the rice. Tilt bowl to discard water,
        keeping the rice in the bowl Repeat 3 more times, until water is less
        cloudy.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a wok or pot, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium-high
        heat. When hot, add the ginger, shallots and the garlic and fry until
        your kitchen smells like heaven. Be careful not to burn the aromatics!
        Add in your drained rice and stir to coat, cook for an additional
        minute. Add the sesame oil, mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 cups of your reserved poaching broth and bring to a boil.
        Immediately turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and cook for 15
        minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (with lid still on) for 5-10
        minutes more. While the rice is cooking, make the sauces and carve the
        chicken for serving.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>MAKE SAUCES To make the chili sauce:</h3>
    <p>
      Blend your chili sauce ingredients in a blender until smooth and bright
      red. To make the ginger garlic sauce: In a small saucepan, heat the
      cooking oil until very hot, when you start seeing wisps of smoke. Turn off
      heat. Immediately add garlic and ginger and let it sizzle for a few
      seconds. Once it settles, stir in salt and vinegar.
