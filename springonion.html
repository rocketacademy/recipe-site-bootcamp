    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 spring onions, washed and thoroughly dried, roots trimmed</li>
      <li>½ cup neutral oil such as rice bran or sunflower</li>
      <li>450g dried wheat noodles</li>
      <li>½ tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1½ tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2-3 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the spring onion into 8cm-long pieces and keep white and green parts
        separated. Cut into thin strips.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place a large frypan on medium-low heat. Add the oil and white parts of
        the spring onion and let them soften into the oil, about 5 minutes.<br />
        Add green parts of the spring onion and allow to cook on low heat for
        25-35 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. <br />The
        onions are ready when they are golden and crispy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add the
        noodles and cook according to package instructions.<br />
        Drain and refresh under cold water to prevent the noodles from sticking.
        Drain again and then place them into a large bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        Combine the soy sauce, dark soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl and stir
        well until the sugar is dissolved.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour the spring onion oil over the noodles, along with the soy sauce
        mixture. Toss to combine. To serve, sprinkle with sesame seeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
