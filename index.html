    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
   <li>1 pack instant curry paste (8 oz. or 250 g)</li>
<li>8 oz. (226 g) peeled potatoes</li>
<li>2 lbs. (1 kg) chicken (4 drumsticks and 4 thighs or 4 leg quarters)</li>
<li>3 shallots, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
<li>2 lemongrass, use the white parts only, pounded</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
<li>2 cups (500 ml) water</li>
<li>1/2 cup (100 ml) coconut milk</li>
<li>1 sprig curry leaves, optional</li></ul>
    <h1>Preparation time:</h1>
    <h3>30minutes</h3>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ul><li>Cut the chicken into pieces. Leave the chicken bone-in. If you prefer boneless chicken meat, then debone the chicken.</li>
    <li>Heat up a deep pot and add the oil. Saute the sliced shallots until aromatic or light brown in color. Add the curry paste into the pot and stir until aromatic. Add the chicken meat and lemongrass. Stir for 1 minute before adding the water.</li>
  <li>Cover the pot and lower the heat to medium. Bring the curry chicken to boil and then lower the heat, add the potatoes and simmer for 20 minutes or so or until the chicken become tender. Add the coconut milk and bring it to boil. Serve hot.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can leave the chicken overnight before adding the coconut milk the next day. This cooking method ensures that the chicken meat is really tender and aromatic as the flavor develops overnight. Serve the chicken curry the next day if you use this method.</li>
  </ul>
